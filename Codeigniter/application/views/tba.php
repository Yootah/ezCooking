 <p> But sadly, not in our case. You are lost. Literally. Period. </p>
 <br>
 Or.... There is a chance that it is our fault and here should be a page. Then yes, our fault, sorry. We will implement it as soon as possible... right?
 <br>
 <p> However, fret not, my friend, for there is a way out of this seemingly desperate situation. </p>
 <br>
 <p> For all you need to do is to head towards <a href="<? echo base_url() ?>welcome">the light</a>, that will help you reach new and amazing places!</p>
